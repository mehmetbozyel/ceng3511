This project is to show price classification by using K-Nearest Neighbour Algorithm.

The data set has 21 columns, the last one is class.

To execute: 'python knn.py'

knn.py file starts to read test.txt and train.txt datas 
that is in the current directory. Then knn values with accuracy and plot graph are expected.
The plot indicates accuracy changes due to knn values from 3 to 10.
